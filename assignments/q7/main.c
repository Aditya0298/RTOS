/*ques=What is the scheduling algorithm used by your RTOS?
answer = sheludling algorithms tells us that which will choose between the priority
which will go execution i.e low priority and high priority in rtos it will always choose high 
priority
. types of scheduling algorithms are:
1.fifo= a thread selected to run continue execution until it
~voluntarily block
~is preempted by a higher priority thread
2.earliest deadline first.
~earliest deadline first or least time to go is a dynamic priorty scheduling algorith used in 
RTOS.
3.rate monotonic scheduling
~it is a priority assignment algorithm 
4. static priortiy driven scheduling
~Most hard real-time systems built and in use to date are static. In the case when tasks in a
 static system are independent, we consider scheduling jobs to a single processor
